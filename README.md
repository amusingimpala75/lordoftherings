# Lord of the Fabric
Fabric port of the Lord of the Rings mod by Mevans

## Issues (Relative to Renewed 2.2):
- Items
    - Tool Attack Speed
        - Not sure how these work
    - Armour
        - Need to fix durability and protections
        - Armour types with multiple textures (ie. harad helmet vs harad warlord helmet)
- Block
    - Rendering of partial blocks
    - Much functionality missing
- Dimension and Biomes
    - Completely missing
